------------------Analoge Signals-------------------------------
I may kick intro the without detailed introduction,
I would like to Start with Types of  Signal.
Note: Note: These types of signals cannot be found directly in the real or physical world; this classification is made only for our understanding and for mathematical analysis.

(i) Deterministic and non-deterministic signals
(ii) Periodic and aperiodic signals
(iii) Even and odd signals
(iv) Causal and noncausal signals
(v) Energy and power signals

Why are we disscussing this now? Well these signals are the results of mathematical equation / the siganls propeties can be calcuated by mathematical equations.

But we missed one important parameter that we have to take in account of any physical measurement.
 :Time:
We need to consider the time for Signal analysis.
So Above Signals are of two Variations.
1) Continious Time
2) Discrete Time.
 to me more Presise it is called Time Domin. Its like POV of signal.Based on once need and Analysis any type of signal can be analysis in different time domin.
