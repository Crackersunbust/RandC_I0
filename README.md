AREA OF APPLICATION :
Most software and devices in the modern world are designed from a human-centric perspective, focusing on ease of use, comfort, and user experience.
However, in the field of Electronics and Embedded Systems, the design primarily revolves around interaction with the physical world.

These interactions often involve parameters beyond human sensory perception, such as:
Electrical quantities: current, voltage, resistance, power, frequency
Environmental parameters: Gas concentration (e.g., SO₂, CO₂, O₂), radiation levels, magnetic field strength, air pressure, vibration, humidity, and sound frequency beyond human hearing.
Optical and chemical properties: UV intensity, infrared radiation, pH level, chemical composition, and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10)

On the other hand, some parameters are directly perceivable by humans, including:
Light intensity and color, temperature, sound, distance (within human limits), motion, and touch/pressure.

Embedded systems bridge the gap between the physical environment and digital intelligence by sensing, measuring, and interpreting both visible and invisible phenomena.
